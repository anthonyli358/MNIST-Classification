# MNIST-Classification
Using Keras to classify images from the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

- Change the ml_model variable at the bottom of main.py to mlp (Multilayer Perceptron) or cnn (Convolutional Neural Network) and run

## Development
- Implemented the MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) neural networks
- Used keras.utils to plot the model architectures available in the 'models' folder
- Explored evaluation metrics for multi-class problems
